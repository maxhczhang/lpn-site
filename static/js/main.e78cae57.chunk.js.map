At a macro level, the housing bubble burst, Dow Jones prices were at a historical low, and 1.2 million jobs were lost within one year. At a micro-level, students felt the impact with rising tuition, curtailed financial aid, and shortage in faculty. To make matters worse, UCI’s business program was still young; its undergraduate business program initiated its first 200 students in the Fall of 2008. Thus, UCI was a school many companies considered dropping their sponsorship and support.\n                    </Box>\n                    <Box fontSize=\"h6.fontSize\" mt={4}>\n                        In the midst of these challenging times, a group of student leaders wanted to create opportunities for UCI’s business students. It began with the Accounting Association Officer Board seeking to make UCI a target school for public accounting firms. While pursuing this vision, a deep camaraderie was formed between the Officers – reflecting a brotherhood like that of a Fraternity. In the summer of 2010, our founding Chief Executive Officer decided to extend this spirit of brotherhood to student leaders in other organizations. Subsequently, the officers from Accounting Association, President and Founder of Merage Undergraduate Student Association, Senior Advisor of Undergraduate Business Association, President of Undergraduate Finance Association, President and Founder of Management Information Student Society, and a Paul Merage MBA candidate convened to form Lambda Phi Nu.\n                    </Box>\n                    <Box fontSize=\"h6.fontSize\" mt={4}>\n                        Although a majority of the Founders already received full-time offers, they spent their senior years mentoring students, growing sponsorships, and launching new initiatives. Their motive was to give back to UCI and cultivate a legacy of student leaders who also wanted to give back. Lambda Phi Nu continues to push to make our school more competitive in the business community through fostering collaboration among student leaders. In the words of the Apostle Paul, “do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves.” Our reason to exist has been and will always be to “Grow Forward, Give Back” – one leader, one community, and one campus at a time.\n                    </Box>\n                </Typography>\n            </Box>\n           \n            <Box>\n                <Typography component=\"div\">\n                    <Box fontSize=\"h2.fontSize\" fontWeight=\"fontWeightBold\">\n                        Chapter Founding & Rebranding\n                    </Box>\n                </Typography>\n            </Box>\n\n            <Box mt={2} className={classes.paragraph}>\n                <Typography component=\"div\">\n                    <Box fontSize=\"h6.fontSize\" style={{ textAlign: \"left\" }}>\n                        The Chapter was founded in 2010 as Beta Alpha Psi and re-branded into Lambda Phi Nu in 2014 due to fundamental differences within organizational structures.

We’ve founded nine of Merage’s business organizations, and every one of our Brothers has achieved Leadership positions in different campus organizations since. Additionally, we have direct relationships with all our Alumni, including our founders! As the only business fraternity founded at UC Irvine, our network is extremely tight knit and we foster relationships with all of our alumni. Each year alumni from all classes, even our founders, come back for fraternity events, to bond with their families, or just to have casual hang outs. This gives our Active Brothers the opportunity to receive first-hand mentorship to help them thrive in the professional world.\",\n    },\n    {\n        question: \"What is Rush?\",\n        answer: \"Our rushing process consists of four events where interested candidates get to meet our Active Brothers, Alumni, and fellow Rushees to help them decide if Lambda Phi Nu is an organization they want to join. It culminates in one invite-only event and a series of interviews with our Brothers. If everything goes well, candidates receive bids to begin the Pledging process!\",\n    },\n    {\n        question: \"Can non-business majors join?\",\n        answer: \"Yes! We value diverse perspectives from all kinds of backgrounds. Even though the majority of our brothers are majoring in Business Administration, some of our Active Brothers are pursuing degrees in Computer Science and Economics. Furthermore, our Brothers work in fields from all sorts of disciplines, including Consulting, UI/UX Design, Project Management, and more! As long as you are interested in learning more about the world of business, we encourage you to rush.\",\n    },\n    {\n        question: \"What qualities do you look for in a candidate?\",\n        answer: \"We look for students with a variety of skills, personalities, and backgrounds! Some common themes include: a genuine growth mindset, a desire to help those in need, and an aptitude for leadership. We accept students in all stages of their personal and professional development, and we encourage you to attend our rush events to learn more about what we value in candidates.\",\n    },\n    {\n        question: \"What is a bid?\",\n        answer: \"Rushee’s receive a “bid” after successfully completing our interview process. The decision to accept a bid and become a Lambda Phi Nu Associate should not be taken lightly! Our Pledging curriculum is demanding; we expect all Associates to be pushed to their limits. However, accepting a bid is the first step you must take in order to grow and become part of our family. \",\n    },\n    {\n        question: \"If I don't get a bid, can I recruit again?\",\n        answer: \"Yes! If you feel that Lambda Phi Nu is the place for you, we encourage you to rush again. That being said, Lambda Phi Nu is not the only professional fraternity at UCI! We encourage you to look at other organizations if you feel you mesh better with their culture.\",\n    },\n    {\n        question: \"What is pledging?\",\n        answer: \"Our Pledging process consists of a seven-week curriculum designed to emulate the professional world.

Our Associates learn how to solve problems, all while forming strong relationships along the way.\",\n    },\n];\n\nexport default { faqsList };","import React, {useEffect} from 'react'\nimport {
