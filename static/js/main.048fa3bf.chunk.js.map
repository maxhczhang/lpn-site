At a macro level, the housing bubble burst, the Dow Jones crashed to a historical low, and 1.2 million jobs were lost within one year. At a micro-level, students felt the impact with rising tuition, curtailed financial aid, and faculty shortages. To make matters worse, UCI’s business program was still young; its undergraduate business program initiated its first 200 students in the Fall of 2008. Thus, UCI was a school many companies considered dropping their sponsorship and support.\n                    </Box>\n                    <Box fontSize=\"h6.fontSize\" mt={4}>\n                        In the midst of these challenging times, a group of student leaders wanted to create opportunities for UCI’s business students. It began with the Accounting Association Officer Board seeking to make UCI a target school for public accounting firms. While pursuing this vision, a deep camaraderie was formed between the Officers – reflecting a brotherhood like that of a Fraternity. In the summer of 2010, our founding Chief Executive Officer decided to extend this spirit of brotherhood to student leaders in other organizations. Subsequently, the Accounting Association Board, President and Founder of Merage Undergraduate Student Association, Senior Advisor of Undergraduate Business Association, President of Undergraduate Finance Association, President and Founder of Management Information Student Society, and a Paul Merage MBA candidate convened to form Lambda Phi Nu.\n                    </Box>\n                    <Box fontSize=\"h6.fontSize\" mt={4}>\n                        Although a majority of the Founders already received full-time offers, they spent their senior years mentoring students, growing sponsorships, and launching new initiatives. Their motive was to give back to UCI and cultivate a legacy of student leaders who also wanted to give back. Lambda Phi Nu continues ther legacy today, working to make our school more competitive in the business world through fostering collaboration among various campus groups and stakeholders. In the words of the Apostle Paul, “do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves.” Our reason to exist has been, and will always be, to “Grow Forward, Give Back” – one leader, one community, and one campus at a time.\n                    </Box>\n                </Typography>\n            </Box>\n           \n            \n            <Typography component=\"div\" className={classes.paragraph}>\n                <Box fontSize=\"h2.fontSize\" fontWeight=\"fontWeightBold\">\n                    Chapter Founding & Rebranding\n                </Box>\n            </Typography>\n           \n\n            <Box mt={2} className={classes.paragraph}>\n                <Typography component=\"div\">\n                    <Box fontSize=\"h6.fontSize\" style={{ textAlign: \"left\" }}>\n                        The Chapter was founded in 2010 as Beta Alpha Psi and re-branded into Lambda Phi Nu in 2014 due to fundamental differences within organizational structures.

As the only business fraternity founded at UC Irvine, our network is extremely tight knit and we foster relationships with all of our alumni.
