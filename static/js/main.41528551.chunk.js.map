At a macro level, the housing bubble burst, the Dow Jones crashed to a historical low, and 1.2 million jobs were lost within one year. At a micro-level, students felt the impact with rising tuition, curtailed financial aid, and faculty shortages. To make matters worse, UCI’s business program was still young; its undergraduate business program initiated its first 200 students in the Fall of 2008. Thus, UCI was a school many companies considered dropping their sponsorship and support.\n                    </Box>\n                    <Box fontSize=\"h6.fontSize\" mt={4}>\n                        In the midst of these challenging times, a group of student leaders wanted to create opportunities for UCI’s business students. It began with the Accounting Association Officer Board seeking to make UCI a target school for public accounting firms. While pursuing this vision, a deep camaraderie was formed between the Officers – reflecting a brotherhood like that of a Fraternity. In the summer of 2010, our founding Chief Executive Officer decided to extend this spirit of brotherhood to student leaders in other organizations. Subsequently, the Accounting Association Board, President and Founder of Merage Undergraduate Student Association, Senior Advisor of Undergraduate Business Association, President of Undergraduate Finance Association, President and Founder of Management Information Student Society, and a Paul Merage MBA candidate convened to form Lambda Phi Nu.\n                    </Box>\n                    <Box fontSize=\"h6.fontSize\" mt={4}>\n                        Although a majority of the Founders already received full-time offers, they spent their senior years mentoring students, growing sponsorships, and launching new initiatives. Their motive was to give back to UCI and cultivate a legacy of student leaders who also wanted to give back. Lambda Phi Nu continues ther legacy today, working to make our school more competitive in the business world through fostering collaboration among various campus groups and stakeholders. In the words of the Apostle Paul, “do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves.” Our reason to exist has been, and will always be, to “Grow Forward, Give Back” – one leader, one community, and one campus at a time.\n                    </Box>\n                </Typography>\n            </Box>\n           \n            \n            <Typography component=\"div\" className={classes.paragraph}>\n                <Box fontSize=\"h2.fontSize\" fontWeight=\"fontWeightBold\">\n                    Chapter Founding & Rebranding\n                </Box>\n            </Typography>\n           \n\n            <Box mt={2} className={classes.paragraph}>\n                <Typography component=\"div\">\n                    <Box fontSize=\"h6.fontSize\" style={{ textAlign: \"left\" }}>\n                        The Chapter was founded in 2010 as Beta Alpha Psi and re-branded into Lambda Phi Nu in 2014 due to fundamental differences within organizational structures.

As the only business fraternity founded at UC Irvine, our network is extremely tight knit and we foster relationships with all of our alumni. Each year alumni from all classes, even our founders, come back for fraternity events, to bond with their families, or just to have casual hang outs. This gives our Active Brothers the opportunity to receive first-hand mentorship to help them thrive in the professional world.\",\n    },\n    {\n        question: \"What is Rush?\",\n        answer: \"Our rushing process consists of four events where interested candidates get to meet our Active Brothers, Alumni, and fellow Rushees to help them decide if Lambda Phi Nu is an organization they want to join. It culminates in one invite-only event and a series of interviews with our Brothers. If everything goes well, candidates receive bids to begin the Pledging process!\",\n    },\n    {\n        question: \"Can non-business majors join?\",\n        answer: \"Yes! We value diverse perspectives from all kinds of backgrounds. Even though the majority of our brothers are majoring in Business Administration, some of our Active Brothers are pursuing degrees in Computer Science and Economics. Furthermore, our Brothers work in fields from all sorts of disciplines, including Consulting, UI/UX Design, Project Management, and more! As long as you are interested in learning more about the world of business, we encourage you to rush.\",\n    },\n    {\n        question: \"What qualities do you look for in a candidate?\",\n        answer: \"We look for students with a variety of skills, personalities, and backgrounds! Some common themes include: a genuine growth mindset, a desire to help those in need, and an aptitude for leadership. We accept students in all stages of their personal and professional development, and we encourage you to attend our rush events to learn more about what we value in candidates.\",\n    },\n    {\n        question: \"What is a bid?\",\n        answer: \"After successfully completing the recruitment and interview process, a bid may be extended to a candidate. A bid is an invitation to participate in the pledge program in order to eventually join the fraternity as an Active Partner.\",\n    },\n    {\n        question: \"If I don't get a bid, can I recruit again?\",\n        answer: \"Yes! If you feel that Lambda Phi Nu is the place for you, we encourage you to rush again. That being said, Lambda Phi Nu is not the only professional fraternity at UCI. We encourage you to look at other organizations if you feel you mesh better with their culture.\",\n    },\n    {\n        question: \"What is pledging?\",\n        answer: \"After accepting a bid, a candidate becomes an Associate and partakes in a 7-week long process to join the fraternity. The time commitment is comparable to a four-unit class or a part-time internship. Led by our Alumni and Active Brothers, our curriculum is designed to emulate the professional world. Associates will gain professional and personal skills through a series of workshops, projects, and presentations all while building meaningful relationships. At the end of the 7 weeks, Associates are considered to join the brotherhood as an Active Partner.\",\n    },\n];\n\nexport default { faqsList };","import React, {useEffect} from 'react'\nimport {
