After discovering the different business fraternities, I rushed for Delta Sigma Pi and Lambda Phi Nu. I found that Lambda Phi Nu was the right fit for me. Everyone was extremely welcoming, and genuine when I talked to them during rush and it made me feel included. Additionally, during the Week 0 social in Aldrich Park when I first met some of the Actives, they invited us to an after social which made me feel like I was already apart of the brotherhood. Aside from that, during the Business Fraternity Panel held by Merage Undergraduate Student Association I had learned about the different professional benefits that Lambda Phi Nu could offer, and that enticed me to join. Overall, Lambda Phi Nu embodies the epitome of tight bonds and professionalism.",
